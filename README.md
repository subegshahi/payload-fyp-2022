     2. Install the client dependencies:

        ```
        npm install
        ```

     3. Start the client development server:
        ```
        npm run dev
        ```

   - To run the server:

     1. Change directory to the server:

        ```
        cd server
        ```

     2. Install the server dependencies:

        ```
        npm install
        ```

     3. Start the server:
        ```
        npm run dev
        ```

5. Access the application:
   Once the client and server are running, you can access the Payload application by opening your web browser and navigating to the specified URL (`http://localhost:5173`).
